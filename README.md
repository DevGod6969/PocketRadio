# PocketRadio
A lightweight .NBS song player for PocketMine Servers

## How to use the plugin?
Put your .nbs files into the generated "songs" folder and reload/restart the server

The songs will automatically start to play.

Use /radio next to skip the current song

Use /radio volume to change your volume

## Where do i get .nbs files?
We collected a library of .nbs songs here: https://forums.pmmp.io/threads/200-nbs-songs.294/

There soon will be a proper, separate website though, where you can submit your own .nbs files, search for songs and download them
